When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
So that no matter which computer you work on locally, you can work on the latest versions of you work. Also,
if something happens to the computer you normally work on, your work is still on github.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Working with others is a situation where pulling yourself is better.  If you're working on a branch from the main master branch and your
code depends on the master currently in place, a auto pull could result in your work behaving differently as a result.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks: cloning an existing repository, happens all on github (no local repository). used to test others' code for yourself
clones: a general copy of a repository. can be used to initially get a repository onto your local computer.
branches: divergent commits from the main line of commits.  used for experimenting with new features also as a way to update
commit histories from local to github and vice versa.
