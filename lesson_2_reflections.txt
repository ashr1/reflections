What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
You get .git inside the directory.  The directory becomes a repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area relates to the commit as not all files from the working directory get committed. Staging area is different
from the repository because it isn't actually part of the repository, it's just an intermediary step to commit changes to
the repo.
